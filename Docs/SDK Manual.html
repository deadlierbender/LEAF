  <h1>24 Plug-In Template Manual</h1>

  <p>This manual describes how to use <span class="name">24U Plug-In Template</span> to develop FileMaker Pro plug-ins. Please read <a href="ReadMe.html">Readme file</a> to learn how to install the template and how to create a testing build of the unmodified template. This tutorial describes how to create a new functionality in the template .</p>
  
  <h2>Steps how to create your own plug-in</h2>

  <h3>1. Understand the Template structure</h3>

  <p><span class="name">24 Plug-In Template</span> (formerly named 24U FM Template) is template project for developing third-party FileMaker external function plug-ins. It consists of these directories:</p>

  <h4>Output</h4>
  <p>Directory for result binary files. Builds of the plug-in are stored there.</p>

  <h4>Projects</h4>
  <p>Project files for XCode, Visual Studio .NET 2003 and Visual Studio 2010 development environments.</p>

  <h4>Sources</h4>
  <p>Source files for the future plug-in. The function of each file is described in the comments inside the file. Source files of the plug-in itself should be placed to this directory.</p>

  <h4>Support</h4>
  <p>Source files which serves as a support for main source files of the plug-in. Support libraries, headers and sources which will not be modified should be placed here.</p>

  <h4>Temp</h4>
  <p>Temporary files, build logs are placed here.</p>

  <h3>2. Prepare your project</h3>

  <p>Make a copy of the template folder and name the copy after your new
    plug-in. Make sure you have the latest FileMaker Plug-In SDK in the
    Support folder. <span class="name">24U Plug-In Template</span> is publicly available with FMPlugInSDK
    folder containing FileMaker Plug-In SDK for FileMaker Pro 12. If you want to develop the plug-in for another version
    of FileMaker Pro copy corresponding SDK to the Support folder.</p>

  <p>The actual FMPlugInSDK can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.filemaker.com/support/technologies/?nav=support-technologies">FileMaker Technologies Support page</a>.</p>

  <p>When you are ready, open the project file matching your development
    environment and try to build all targets to make sure you have all
    necessary includes and libraries in place.</p>
    
  <h4>Visual Studio Note</h4>
  <p>Open the solution file with the "sln" extension, not the "vcproj"
    file. In Visual Studio's terminology, you will be working with
    a solution that consists of a single project - the plug-in.</p>

  <h4>XCode Note</h4>
  <p>The project file is prepared for universal binary builds. Project is configured to
    use Mac OS X 10.6 SDK for Intel builds. 10.6 SDK must be present in /Developer/SDKs folder to
    successfully build the plug-in. It can be found on XCode installation disk if
    missing.</p>

  <h3>3. Set up the basics</h3>
  
  <p>Begin the development of a new plug-in by opening the "FMTConfig.h"
    header file and setting up the constants accordingly. This file is
    divided into 4 sections. Always pay attention to the first section -
    Shared constants. Actually, the most important constants are
    <span class="xcode_macro">PLUGIN_ID_STRING</span>, <span class="xcode_macro">WANT_PREFERENCES</span>, <span class="xcode_macro">WANT_IDLE</span>, <span class="xcode_macro">PLUGIN_NAME</span>, and
    <span class="xcode_macro">PLUGIN_INFO</span>. They are used to generate mandatory resources and code
    FileMaker applications use to recognize the plug-in and to display
    it correctly in the calculation and preferences dialogs.</p>

  <p>The <span class="xcode_macro">PLUGIN_ID_STRING</span> constant is a 4 characters long ID of your plug-in.
    According to the FileMaker's Developer Guide: The ID must be unique for
    each plug-in and must not begin with "F", "FM", or "Web" as these IDs
    are reserved by FileMaker, Inc. For the Mac OS X, it used to be
    recommended that you set the creator type of the plug-in to this
    same value. Unfortunately, Mac OS X currently does not look for icons
    in plug-ins, so we recommend you leave the HFS creator set to '????',
    so that Mac OS X deducts the correct icon from the plug-in's extension.</p>
    
  <p>To make sure you will use a unique ID, you should register the ID as a
    creator code at the Apple Developer Technical Support web site even if
    you won't be creating a Mac OS X version of your plug-in. To register
    IDs, go to the support pages on the Apple Computer web site at
    <a href="http://developer.apple.com/">Apple Developer Connection</a> and look for a link to Creator Type or
    Data Type Registration.</p>
    
  <p>The <span class="xcode_macro">WANT_PREFERENCES</span> constant defines if your plug-in should have the
    "Configure..." button enabled in the plug-ins panel of the FileMaker
    Application Preferences dialog box. If you set this constant to 1, the
    button will be enabled and after clicking on it, your Preferences()
    function in the "FMPluginHandlers.cpp" file will get called.</p>
    
  <p>Set the <span class="xcode_macro">WANT_IDLE</span> constant to 1 if you want FileMaker to call your
    plug-in periodically in idle time to let it do any idle processing. If
    you set this constant to 1, your idle functions in the
    "FMPluginHandlers.cpp" file will be called periodically whenever the
    FileMaker application has nothing else to do. If you don't need any
    idle processing, set this constant to 0 so that you don't steal
    processing time from FileMaker.</p>
    
  <p>Define the plug-in's name and description in the <span class="xcode_macro">PLUGIN_NAME</span> and
    <span class="xcode_macro">PLUGIN_INFO</span> constants. These will be used, besides other places, by
    FileMaker in its Application Preferences dialog box and in the
    calculation dialog's list of external functions. Also define the
    <span class="xcode_macro">PLUGIN_VERSION</span> constant to match the version of your plug-in, so that it
    is possible to check the plug-in's version from within a FileMaker Pro
    script.</p>
    
  <p>The remaining constants are used mainly to define the Mac OS X
    identification information and the Windows file properties list. The
    constant names and their sample values should be self-descriptive so it
    should be quite simple to set them properly.</p>
    
  <h3>4. Add new functions</h3>

  <p>With the <span class="name">24U Plug-In Template</span>, adding new functions to your plug-in is quite
    simple. To define a new function, open the "FMTConfig.h" header file,
    scroll to the "Function definitions" section, and uncomment the first
    commented block of #defines. Then change the four macros according to
    the function you are going to create.</p>

  <p>There are 10 predefined function definition blocks in the FMTConfig.h
    file, which should be enough for most plug-ins. By default, there is one
    function already defined for your convenience - the Version function.</p>
    
  <p>Let's say you want to add a second function named "MyFunction" to your
    plug-in. This function is going to take two parameters, the first one
    being required, and the second one optional. To define this function as
    a second function of your plug-in, available for both client and
    server-side calculations, uncomment the second definition block and
    modify it to look like this:</p>
    
  <pre class="xcode_macro">
    #define FUNCTION_2_C_NAME     MyFunction
    #define FUNCTION_2_FLAGS      fmx::ExprEnv::kMayEvaluateOnServer | \
                                  fmx::ExprEnv::kDisplayInAllDialogs
    #define FUNCTION_2_PARAMS     kAtLeast_1_Parameter, kAtWorst_2_Parameters
    #define FUNCTION_2_PROTOTYPE  "MyFunction( param1; { param2 } )"
  </pre>

  <p>After this modification, you should add source code for the function
    "MyFunction" to the project so that it can be registered by the
    initialization handler in the "FMTemplate.cpp" file. Your function
    should have the following prototype:</p>

  <pre>
    FMX_PROC(fmx::errcode) MyFunction(       short          funcId,
                                       const fmx::ExprEnv&  environment,
                                       const fmx::DataVect& dataVect,
                                             fmx::Data&     result )
  </pre>

  <p>We suggest that you write the function code in a new file named
    "MyFunction.cpp" after the function. This way you will keep the project
    clean and all external functions easily accessible. Save the new file
    into the "Source" folder, and add it to all targets of the project you
    are using.</p>

  <p>You don't have to create header files with your external function
    prototypes to include into the "FMTemplate.cpp" file. All external
    functions will get declared automatically, using the definitions from
    the "FMTConfig.h" header file. All you need to edit are the files you
    create on your own and the predefined files in the "Source" folder.</p>
    
  <h3>5. Edit the startup, shutdown, preferences, and idle routines</h3>

  <p>Code for these four kinds of optional routines can be found in the
    "FMPluginHandlers.cpp" file. Feel free to change these routines to fit
    your needs. Follow the inline instructions in the file when editing
    these functions, and don't forget to update the "FMTConfig.h" header
    file accordingly if you use the Preferences or Idle routines.</p>

  <h3>6. Test and debug</h3>

  <p>To test and debug your new plug-in, you should start by building
    a special debug version of it. Follow the instructions for your
    development environment below:</p>

  <h4>XCode</h4>
  <p>Simply click on the Run button. The project is adjusted for building universal binary with two architectures.</p>

  <h4>Visual Studio 2003</h4>
  <p>Switch the solution's configuration to "Debug", and build the
    solution.</p>
    
  <h4>Visual Studio 2010</h4>
  <p>Switch the solution's configuration to "Debug" x64 or Win32, and build the
    solution.</p>
  <p>The 64-bit built plug-in is only compatible with 64-bit FileMaker process which is the Custom Web Publishing running on 64-bit platform. For more information about testing 64-bit plug-in via Custom Web Publishing read <a href="./Testing64bitPlug-In.html">How to test 64-bit plug-in</a>. For other purposes use the 32-bit plug-in.</p>

  <p>By default, the debug version of your plug-in will be built into the
    Output folder and named "FMPluginDebug.fmplugin" for Mac OS X and
    "FMPluginDebug.fmx" for Windows. However, if you are familiar with your
    development environment, you can have it built directly into the
    FileMaker's Extensions folder for easier debugging. Just don't forget
    to remove the debug version when you put the final version to the
    Extensions folder, otherwise the two copies of the same plug-in will
    interfere.</p>
    
  <h4>Finder Note</h4>
  <p>Do not rename built plug-in in Finder. Binary name can be changed 
    in development environment.</p>

  <h4>Plug-in name note</h4>
  <p>Plug-in name should not begin by number (ie. 3DPlugin.fmplugin).
    If so it will have incorrect behaviour in FileMaker 8.0 on Mac OS X.
    This is probably a bug in FileMaker.</p>

  <h3>7. Build and release</h3>
  
  <p>When you think your plug-in is finished and free of bugs, you can build
    a release version and start using or distributing it. Build the 
    "FMPlugin Release" configuration in Visual Studio .NET, or 
    the "Deployment" build style in XCode.</p>

  <p>The release version of your plug-in will be built into the Output folder
    and named "FMPlugin.fmplugin" for Mac OS X and "FMPlugin.fmx" for Windows.</p>
    
  <h2>Things to never change</h2>

  <p>Do not change the files contained within the "Support" folder unless you
    are sure you have reached limits of this template and you are
    experienced enough to change the structure of the template.</p>

  <p>If you want to use other 3rd-party libraries or sample code in your
    project(s) as standalone code which you are not going to edit, it is a
    good idea to add them also into the "Support" folder. In general, the
    "Sources" folder is intended for your own source code, and the "Support"
    folder for read-only support files provided by other parties.</p>

  <p>Do not remove the PluginVersion function from your plug-in. You may
    modify the function to be smarter than the predefined one but you should
    never release a plug-in without a version function. If your plug-in does
    not have a version function, developers will not be able to check if
    they are using the right version of your plug-in.</p>

  <p>Once you release your plug-in, never change ID's of your functions. If
    you want to reorder them you will need to modify the order in which your
    functions are registered in the initialization function of the
    "FMTemplate.cpp" file but never change the function ID's as they are
    stored in FileMaker databases using them. Changing your function ID's
    would make your plug-in incompatible with its previous version.</p>

  <h2>Development Environments</h2>

  <p><span class="name">24U Plug-In Template</span> contains ready to use projects for two different
    development environments - Apple XCode and Microsoft Visual Studio versions .NET 2003 and 2010. 
    Use XCode to build FileMaker plug-ins on Macintosh and Visual Studio
    to build FileMaker plug-ins on Windows.</p>

  <h2>Apple XCode note</h2>

  <p>Xcode doesn't directly support automatic generation of property list
    and resource files using definitions from header files and plc
    template files. To let you minimize work overhead when developing
    with XCode and still building a Windows plug-in from the same source
    code, <span class="name">24U Plug-In Template</span> faces this problem using the "Shell Script
    Build Phase". It executes the script 24u_plist_compiler.sh which does
    all the work. Note that the user building the plug-in must have the
    permission to execute this script.</p>

  <h2>Objective-C note</h2>

  <p>Apple Cocoa library is the default way how to create UI on Mac OS X. The 24U Plug-In Template
    is written in C++ language, Cocoa uses Objective-C language. If you want to use Cocoa in
    the plug-in you must declare that you need to compile the source files as Objective-C++.
    This can be done by two ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>By renaming all *.cpp files to *.mm files. This can be problematic if you want to create a 
      multiplatform plug-in which should be buildable on Windows. If you create a Mac-only plug-in this is the better way.</li>
    <li>Set *.cpp files as objective-c++. This can be done by right-clicking to the file 
      in XCode, choose Get Info, tab General and File Type to sourcecode.cpp.objcpp. 
      XCode will start to compile these files as objective-c++. All objective-c code should be 
      separated from C++ code by #ifdef __OBJC__ #endif macros so objective-c code does not interfere with
      C++ code on Windows.</li>
  </ul>
